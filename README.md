# EdgeGrid for .NET/C#

This library implements an Authentication handler for the Akamai EdgeGrid Authentication scheme in .NET/C#.

You can find all Akamai APIs at https://techdocs.akamai.com/home/page/apis.

## Project organization

| Folder | Description|
| -------- | --------- |
| `/EdgeGridAuth` | The core auth signer project. |
| `/EdgeGridAuthTest` | The MSTest unit tests. |
| `/OpenAPI` | The generic `openapi.exe` tool to demonstrate using the signer. |
| `/Akamai.EdgeGrid.Auth.sln` | The root Visual Studio solution. |

## Install

1. Open `Akamai.EdgeGrid.Auth.sln` in Visual Studio and rebuild all or run `MSBuild.exe Akamai.EdgeGrid.Auth.sln /t:rebuild`.

2. Copy `Akamai.EdgeGrid.Auth.sln` to your application or solution.

## Authentication

We provide authentication credentials through an API client. Requests to the API are signed with a timestamp and are executed immediately.

1. [Create authentication credentials](https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/set-up-authentication-credentials).
   
2. Place your credentials in an EdgeGrid resource file, `.edgerc`, under a heading of `[default]` at your local home directory or the home directory of a web-server user.

    ```
    [default]
    client_secret = C113nt53KR3TN6N90yVuAgICxIRwsObLi0E67/N8eRN=
    host = akab-h05tnam3wl42son7nktnlnnx-kbob3i3v.luna.akamaiapis.net
    access_token = akab-acc35t0k3nodujqunph3w7hzp7-gtm6ij
    client_token = akab-c113ntt0k3n4qtari252bfxxbsl-yvsdj
    ```

## Use

To use the library, create an instance of the `EdgeGridV1Signer` and call either `Sign()` (if you're managing the HTTP communication yourself) or `Execute()` to use the built-in safety checks.

Provide details of your credentials from your local `.edgerc` resource file and pass them to the `ClientCredential()` method.

```csharp
using Akamai.EdgeGrid.Auth;

string clientToken = "akab-c113ntt0k3n4qtari252bfxxbsl-yvsdj";
string accessToken = "akab-acc35t0k3nodujqunph3w7hzp7-gtm6ij";
string secret = "C113nt53KR3TN6N90yVuAgICxIRwsObLi0E67/N8eRN=";

var signer = new EdgeGridV1Signer();
var credential = new ClientCredential(clientToken, accessToken, secret);

//TODO: create httpRequest via WebRequest.Create(uri);
signer.Sign(httpRequest, credential);
```

Alternatively, you can use the `Execute()` method to manage the connection and perform verification checks.

```csharp
using Akamai.EdgeGrid.Auth;

string clientToken = "akab-c113ntt0k3n4qtari252bfxxbsl-yvsdj";
string accessToken = "akab-acc35t0k3nodujqunph3w7hzp7-gtm6ij";
string secret = "C113nt53KR3TN6N90yVuAgICxIRwsObLi0E67/N8eRN=";

var signer = new EdgeGridV1Signer();
var credential = new ClientCredential(clientToken, accessToken, secret);

//TODO: create httpRequest via WebRequest.Create(uri);
signer.Execute(httpRequest, credential);
```

## Sample application (openapi.exe)

A sample application is available. It takes command line parameters.

```openapi.exe
-a akab-acc35t0k3nodujqunph3w7hzp7-gtm6ij
-c akab-c113ntt0k3n4qtari252bfxxbsl-yvsdj
-s C113nt53KR3TN6N90yVuAgICxIRwsObLi0E67/N8eRN=
